TODO: there should not be a default chat, but a welcome screen.
      due to the nature of how the  encryption works, having an
      all-inclusive channel doesn't make sense.
      maybe?
      idk.

      Ultimately, what needs to happen is that people can create and join channels.
      When someone joins a channel, they will receive all the public keys of the
      members of that channel.

      This channel behavior could work for an 'all' channel, but may result in
      too much noise.
